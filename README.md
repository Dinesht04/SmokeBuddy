## SmokeParty. Manage your Smoking Groups without smoking your head. 

In this Decentralized app, users can make a wallet, deposit funds, create and manage smoking groups all on the Solana Blockchain.

The smoke party can be initiated by any member, as long as they have enough sol that represents buying a Cigaratte / choti advance / the cigarette they choose from our vast database.

The user in the group is notified only when he/she has enough Sol to contribute to the cigarette in their wallet when a SmokeParty starts.

## The backend handles all the contribution logic, i.e. :-

⇒ Deducting Funds from participating members

⇒ Sending those funds to the guy who bought the cigarette

## Rank Based System

Groups have ranks based on who buys the cigarettes the most and more fun ranks, which make the platform fun and interactive
